# Misc — Experimental Documents & Mini Projects

This repository serves as a collection of **experimental documents, small prototypes, drafts, and exploratory work**.
Each idea or experiment is placed in its own subfolder, and the contents may change frequently.

## Purpose

* Store drafts, notes, and early-stage ideas
* Prototype small tools or workflows
* Keep experimental scripts and research snippets in one place
* Maintain temporary or evolving work before it becomes part of a dedicated repository

## Notes

* Many items here are **work-in-progress** or **experimental**.
* Content may change, be reorganized, or removed at any time.
* This repository is primarily for **personal research and exploration**, not production use.
